# Moir√©e

An app for creating a grid of ratings from critics at film festivals.

## Authentication
Authentication to the app is invitation-based. Admins and Critics are invited by authenticated Admins.
Authentication was originally setup with [authentication-zero](https://github.com/lazaronixon/authentication-zero)

### Critics Invite Flow

When a Critic is invited, their account is created and they're sent a passwordless login link via email. Following that link logs them in permanently (for now).

### Inviting Admins

When an Admin is invited, their account is created and they're sent a link to reset their password. Once they log in, they have all the power and responsibility of a system admin.
